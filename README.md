## Installation

### Chrome Extension Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Install MongoDB if you haven't already:
   - [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

4. Start your MongoDB server:
   ```
   # On Windows
   "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="C:\data\db"
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   mongod --dbpath /data/db
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

6. The server will run at `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Connecting to Backend

1. Make sure your backend server is running
2. Check if CORS is properly configured in your server
3. Verify the `BACKEND_URL` in `popup.js` matches your server address

### Data Not Saving

2. Make sure MongoDB is running and accessible
3. Check the server logs for any database connection issues

### Reset Button Not Working

1. Make sure you've added the reset button to your HTML
2. Verify the event listener is properly set up in `popup.js`
3. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
